    """

    This is the Syntax Validator module of the Application.
    Here, an email is received and that is validated against some set of RFCs.

    RFC-822 is probably obselete now, still used at some place.
    RFC-6531 is probably the most recent one. And hence being the latest, it is
    mandatory to syntax validate the email against this RFC. RFC-6531 considers under
    its purview some UTF-8 characters also.

    For more information, please consider reading the following docs/links:
    > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address
    > https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531
